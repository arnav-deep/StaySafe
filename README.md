Android app to warn people of dangerous animals in the area.

# Why StaySafe?
IIITDM Jabalpur campus is situtated right beside Dumna Nature Reserve. Dumna Nature Reserve is home to many fauna. Out of all of the fauna, Leopards and Deer have frequented the campus by jumping over the boundary walls.

StaySafe, is the android application to the IoT based, Image Processing project on Raspberry Pi. This app notifies users about the location where the leopard has been detected in real-time and also provides an SOS button and Emergency Contacts.
